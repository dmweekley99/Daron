        My Story
    </h1>
    <p>
        From the quaint streets of Sistersville, WV, nestled in the scenic Ohio Valley, 
        my academic and professional journey has been driven by a fervent passion for science and technology. 
        Born and raised in a town where everyone knows your name, I graduated from Tyler Consolidated High School 
        in 2016 and embarked on an educational odyssey that led me from human biology to computer science, 
        culminating in a promising career in software development.

        My undergraduate years were spent at West Liberty University, a period marked by active 
        engagement both academically and socially. During this time, I served as a Resident Assistant, 
        led as President of the Kappa Delta Kappa fraternity, and delved into research that would yield my first scientific 
        publication. My research focused on the effects of a novel antibiotic on the bacterium <i>Francisella tularensis</i>,
        aiming to identify the specific gene affected by the antibiotic. This early exposure to the intricacies of biological research 
        was just the beginning. In 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Biology, equipped with knowledge and an 
        insatiable curiosity about life's molecular underpinnings.

        Continuing at West Liberty University for my Master's studies, 
        I specialized in Biomedical Sciences, where my research centered 
        on how maternal hyperthyroidism (Grave's Disease) leads to thyrotoxicosis 
        in an avian model. This project not only honed my research skills but also my 
        proficiency in statistical analysis using the R programming language. In 2022, 
        I proudly earned a Master of Science in Biology, a testament to my dedication 
        and academic prowess.

        Seeking further challenges and deeper knowledge, I was accepted into 
        Marshall University's Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. program. Here, I engaged 
        deeply with biochemistry, neurology, and cell biology. My research under 
        Dr. Chris Risher explored the impact of maternal opioid use on infants 
        using a murine model, involving techniques such as dissections, cell culture, 
        and ImageJ analysis. Concurrently, in Dr. Alejandro Nato's lab, I contributed 
        to the development of an accessible database for human genes, enhancing my 
        skills in R programming, Python, Bash scripting, and genomic databases. However, 
        by March 2023, I realized that my true calling was not in a lab but in the realm of 
        software development, prompted by my extensive bioinformatics work. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Transitioning from biomedical sciences, I pursued and was accepted into the Computer 
        Science Master's program at Marshall University in June 2023. Achieving a notable GPA 
        of 4.00 in my master's classes, my studies included advanced computing languages and frameworks such as React, 
        Django, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Git/GitHub, and Java. These tools have not only equipped me 
        with the necessary skills, but have also ignited a passion for developing software solutions 
        that address real-world problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As I continue on this transformative journey, I am eager to leverage my extensive research background 
        and newfound software development skills in a dynamic new role. My unique blend of experiences from the 
        laboratory to coding make me a versatile and valuable candidate for positions within the tech industry. 
        I invite you to consider my diverse skill set and academic achievements as I seek to contribute 
        meaningfully to your team.
